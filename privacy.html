<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Last updated: January 2025</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how this experimental automation tool ("the Service") processes information.
The Service is used to generate and upload AI-enhanced gaming videos to TikTok via the TikTok Content Posting API.
</p>

<h2>1. Information Collected</h2>
<p>
The Service does not collect or store any personally identifiable information.
It does not request passwords, financial data, private messages, or sensitive personal data.
</p>

<p>
The only data processed is:
<ul>
    <li>video files provided by the user,</li>
    <li>API tokens required for authorization with TikTok,</li>
    <li>technical metadata necessary to perform video upload operations.</li>
</ul>
This data is used strictly for generating and uploading videos to TikTok.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
No data is permanently stored by the Service. 
Temporary files and tokens may be stored locally or within the automation environment (e.g., n8n),
solely to complete upload tasks.
</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The Service interacts only with TikTok’s official API. 
No data is shared with external advertising, analytics, or tracking services.
</p>

<h2>4. User Control</h2>
<p>
Users may discontinue use of the Service at any time. 
Tokens and uploaded content can be deleted manually by the user.
